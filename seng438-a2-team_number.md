# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Our unit test strategy will begin with each team member individually and carefully going through the documentation of both of the classes to be tested: org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range. This will allow each one of us to gain an understanding of the functionality of the methods we will be testing inside these classes before creating our test suite. Once this step is done we will proceed to split up the tests between the group members to facilitate with the workload, however, we will make sure to reconvene and go through each other's tests to make sure we all have an understanding of all the tests.
